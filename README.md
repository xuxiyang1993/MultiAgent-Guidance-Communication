# MultiAgent-Guidance-Communication
 
A Python implementation of the algorithm proposed in paper "Multi Agent Autonomous On-Demand Free Flight Operations in Urban Air Mobility using Monte Carlo Tree Search"

A short video demo of this algorithm: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6AkCCt-9nI&t=

## Requirements

* python 3.6
* numpy
* gym
* collections
* ...


## Getting Started

Make sure that you have the above requirements taken care of, then download all the files. You can run it using

```
cd MCTS
python Agent_vertiport.py
```

Optional arguments:

`--save_path` the path where you want to save the output

`--seed` seed of the experiment

`--render` if render the env while running exp


If you have any questions or comments, don't hesitate to send me an email! I am looking for ways to make this code even more computationally efficient.
